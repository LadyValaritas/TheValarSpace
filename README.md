All my little proyects and incomplete thoughts
I'm a Math student. I really love learn new things and do everything that means a challenge, probably until no.
+I'm a spanish speaker, but i'm trying with english for practice and being more profesional, so maybe i have some mistakes with that.
I'm an enthusiast of gaming things but i'm not a gamer.
Love make crochet and origami. Also Mandalas and journal.
This is my first proyect so, enjoy all <3
